This is a version of the Global-Local Model that uses multiple input features instead of selecting the local representation from a shared embedding. This is needed to get a pytorch models that is exportable via ONNX.

* Usage
Right now the features are dispatched to one of the pooling models (=global= or =local=) based on the prefix of the feature name.

The =mask-conll-to-json.py= is used to convert the masked conll files used by the original implementation into a json (or jsonl) format.
